<h2>Lockpick Village by Longhorn Locksport</h2>

<p>The Longhorn Lockpicking Club was chartered in 2006 as a student organization at the University of Texas, Austin. Over the years is has become one of the most active chapters of its parent organization, Locksport International, and continues to meet regularly near campus. Longhorn Lockpicking is open to all!</p>

<p>The term 'locksport' was coined for the growing sport and hobby of lockpicking, and as a locksport club our goal is to provide a safe and responsible atmosphere for hobbyist lockpickers to share knowledge and experience while practicing their hobby.
</p>
<p>ll skill levels are welcome, especially newcomers to the hobby. </p>
  <p>They have a meetup page <a href="https://www.meetup.com/lockpick/">here</a> if you would like to learn more!</p>

  <p>There will be a competition during BSides Austin with prizes!</p>
