<h2>Capture The Flag by MetaCTF </h2>

<p>The team at MetaCTF is excited to run the Capture the Flag competition at BSides Austin this year! Our jeopardy-style CTF will have plenty of challenges for participants at all skill levels, so whether you’re a seasoned CTF player or a beginner, there will be something for you! CTFs are a great way to learn, and our goal is for you to walk away with some new tools, techniques, and skills. You’ll need a laptop to participate. Teams can have up to 4 people, or you may compete as an individual. Check out the CTF preparation guide (<a href="https://metactf.com/prep">https://metactf.com/prep</a>) for a brief overview of what to expect.

<h2>Lockpick Village by Longhorn Locksport</h2>

<p>At BSIDES AUSTIN, the locksport village will be staffed with volunteers
from Longhorn Lockpicking Club, Bobcat Locksport, and Alamo City
Locksport providing both competition and instruction. We provide
intrigue and challenge, drawing participants eager to test their skills
in lockpicking and security bypass techniques.</p>

<p>Our booth is set up with tables covered in a variety of lock types, from
standard pin tumblers to complex disc detainer and combination locks,
offering challenges for all skill levels. At one side, an instructional
area is staffed with knowledgeable instructors who give live
demonstrations and tips on techniques like raking, single-pin picking,
and impressioning. We cover the basics of lock anatomy and tension
control, as well as legal and ethical guidelines around lockpicking as a
skill for hobbyists and security professionals.</p>

<p>For the competition, participants race against the clock to open a
series of progressively harder locks. Timers, scoreboards, and judging
staff keep the energy high, and friendly competition thrives as
attendees cheer for each other’s successes. Each level completed earns
points, with special bonuses for difficult or unique locks.</p>

<p>This year we have a dueling nerf challenge to which you can challenge
someone to see who can pick the container open first to reveal a nerf
gun to be able to shoot the other first. There will be a bracket leaving
one loan survivor after single elimination and the winner will win a
tactical lockpicking book donated by our friends at Uncensored Tactical.
May the picks be ever in your favor!</p>

<p>In between rounds, the booth also hosts hands-on workshops where
anyone, from beginners to experts, can try their hand at opening
different lock models and practice their skills under expert guidance.
The locksport booth encourages a spirit of curiosity, collaboration, and
responsible exploration, creating an engaging, hands-on learning
environment for everyone in attendance.</p>
