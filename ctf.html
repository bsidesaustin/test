<h2>Capture The Flag by MetaCTF </h2>

<p>The team at MetaCTF is excited to run the Capture the Flag competition at BSides Austin this year! Our jeopardy-style CTF will have plenty of challenges for participants at all skill levels, so whether you’re a seasoned CTF player or a beginner, there will be something for you! CTFs are a great way to learn, and our goal is for you to walk away with some new tools, techniques, and skills. You’ll need a laptop to participate. Teams can have up to 4 people, or you may compete as an individual. Check out the CTF preparation guide (<a href="https://metactf.com/prep">https://metactf.com/prep</a>) for a brief overview of what to expect. For a practice environment with challenges and solutions from previous competitions, go here (<a href="https://mctf.io/practice">https://mctf.io/practice</a>).</p>

<h2>Lockpick Village by Longhorn Locksport</h2>

<p>The Longhorn Lockpicking Club was chartered in 2006 as a student organization at the University of Texas, Austin. Over the years is has become one of the most active chapters of its parent organization, Locksport International, and continues to meet regularly near campus. Longhorn Lockpicking is open to all!</p>

<p>The term 'locksport' was coined for the growing sport and hobby of lockpicking, and as a locksport club our goal is to provide a safe and responsible atmosphere for hobbyist lockpickers to share knowledge and experience while practicing their hobby.
</p>
<p>ll skill levels are welcome, especially newcomers to the hobby. </p>
  <p>They have a meetup page <a href="https://www.meetup.com/lockpick/">here</a> if you would like to learn more!</p>

  <p>There will be a competition during BSides Austin with prizes!</p>
