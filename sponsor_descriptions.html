  <h2>Deepfactor</h2>

<p>Deepfactor is a developer security platform that enables engineering teams to quickly discover and resolve security vulnerabilities and supply chain risks early in development and testing. With a single cost-effective solution, Deepfactor integrates runtime security, software composition analysis (SCA), software bill of materials (SBOM), and dynamic application security testing (DAST) to consolidate DevSecOps tooling. Unlike traditional AppSec tools, the Deepfactor runtime correlation technology automatically prioritizes and filters alerts for developers based on usage, providing critical context that streamlines remediation and reduces alert fatigue.
