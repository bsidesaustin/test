<p>
Founded in 2018, Recon InfoSec specializes in Managed Security Operations (MSO), believing it is the core of effective cybersecurity.
Security Operations is the process of gathering information from across an organization's environment and using it effectively for cyber defense. At its best, Security Operations provides threat-centric, data-driven insight to help the organization make better Risk Management decisions, optimize its current IT investment, and respond immediately to active threats. Effective Security Operations requires process, technology, and people. Recon MSO includes all three.
The result is distinctively effective security operations that our customers love.
