<h1>Why reschedule?</h1>

<p>We’ve been following the news of COVID-19 since it first appeared in China late last year. Once it became a global crisis, we held onto a hope that if it came to the United States it would be handled effectively and contained quickly. When it did come to the US, we still honestly thought we could muscle through this and hold our event in April as planned.</p>

<p>However, it has become clear that things are likely to get worse before they get better. Numbers of cases and deaths are escalating, and we still don’t have a clear understanding of how widespread this is or how it’s being managed.</p>

<p>Because we are loath to put our attendees, volunteers, speakers, trainers, sponsors, and CTF organizers in danger by bringing them together, we are postponing BSides Austin 2020 until December 10-11.</p>

<p>We truly hope you agree with us that caution is warranted in this situation and that you will attend our conference on these new dates. We have closed our Eventbrite ticket sales until the end of March so we can process refund requests for people who bought tickets for the original dates but can’t attend our event in December. The Eventbrite site will reopen on April 1 for sales to our rescheduled conference.</p>

<p>We appreciate your understanding and your support. We hope to see you in December.</p>



<h1>FAQ about the rescheduling of BSides Austin 2020</h1>

<p><strong><em>Why have the original April conference dates been rescheduled?</em></strong></p>
<p>Because we are loath to put our attendees, volunteers, speakers, sponsors, trainers, and CTF organizers in danger by bringing them together during the COVID-19 crisis. We cannot be sure that it will be contained by early April and are unwilling to take chances with the health and safety of our security community.</p>

<p><strong><em>What are the new dates for BSides Austin 2020?</em></strong></p>
<p>BSides Austin is now scheduled for December 8-11. Our two days of training courses are offered on December 8-9, and the conference runs December 10-11.</p>

<p><strong><em>Where will the conference be held?</em></strong></p>
<p>We will be holding BSides Austin at the same facility: Commons Learning Center on the J.J. Pickle Research Campus at The University of Texas at Austin.</p>


<p><strong><em>Will the ticket I already purchased work for the new dates?</em></strong></p>
<p>Yes, any ticket purchased for the original April dates will apply to the new conference dates. We’ll see you in December!</p>

<p><strong><em>Can I buy tickets now for the new dates?</em></strong></p>
<p>The BSides Austin Eventbrite site has been shut down while we process requested refunds for attendees who can’t make the new dates. Ticket sales for the new dates will resume on April 1.
</p>

<p><strong><em>Will the new dates feature the same speakers/schedule as the original April dates?</em></strong></p>
<p>We certainly hope that all our speakers will be able to give their talks on our new dates, but there are likely to be some changes based on schedule conflicts. The schedule will be updated as necessary on bsidesaustin.com.</p>


<p><strong><em>Is there any chance the dates for the conference could change again later?</em></strong></p>
<p>We certainly hope not, but we just can’t know for sure. We chose dates late in the year in the hope that by that time this crisis might be contained and business would be back to normal. Fingers crossed!</p>

<p><strong><em>How do I get a refund for my ticket if I can’t come to the conference in December?</em></strong></p>
<p>We truly hope you agree with us that caution is warranted in this situation and that you will choose to keep your ticket and attend our conference on these new dates. However, because of these unusual circumstances and despite our customary no-refund policy, we will allow you to return your ticket if you choose. Requests must be made by Tuesday, March 31 using this form: <a href="https://forms.gle/uzNm7BShfr9CGQPZA">https://forms.gle/uzNm7BShfr9CGQPZA</a> </p>
