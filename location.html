<h1>Parking</h1>
  <p>You must use a  PARKING PERMIT (this will be added before the event) for both days at BSides Austin. Closer to the event dates, we will provide a permit that you can download and PRINT, then place it in plain view on your dashboard.</p>
<p><strong>Without this parking permit on your dash you <em>will</em> get a ticket.</strong></p>
<p>We have been advised that UT security is <em>very diligent</em> about monitoring the parking when there is a big event like ours. In fact, they have also been known to ticket if you have a tire on a parking space line or on any grass.</p>
<p>* We have no power to help you get out of a ticket if you get one.</p>
<p><strong>You can avoid the whole parking mess:</strong></p>
<p>The Austin MetroRapid bus stop is located on Exploration Way on the west side of the Commons Building and offers transit daily along a 15-mile route through Austin. For more information, please see: <a href="https://www.capmetro.org/schedmap/?svc=0&amp;f1=803&amp;s=0&amp;d=N" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cap Metro Route 803</a>.</p>

<h1>Hotels</h1>
<p>If you're coming into Austin for our event and need a room, you'll find a list of hotels located within a three-mile radius of the conference center: <a href="https://commons.utexas.edu/meetings-and-events/area-hotels">https://commons.utexas.edu/meetings-and-events/area-hotels</a> </p>
