  <h1><strong>FAQ</strong></h1>

  
  <p><em>Last updated: November 16, 2022</em><br></p>

<p><strong>What if I bought a ticket to the 2020 conference that was canceled because of Covid and didn’t ask for a refund?</strong></p>
  <p>First, thank you so much for sticking with us through this strange time. Here’s how we are handling your situation:</p>
  <p>
<ul>
  <li>Before we made the free tickets for this December 2022 virtual conference available to the general public, we emailed the address you used to purchase your 2020 ticket to ensure you had first dibs on a ticket.</li>
  <li>If you didn’t grab your ticket during that pre-sale, we obviously still hope you take advantage of this conference by registering now.</li>
  <li>We are planning an in-person BSides Austin 2023 for spring. Your 2020 ticket purchase means you have a ticket to that event if you want it. We will be in touch with you closer to that conference to inform you of how to register for your pre-paid ticket.</li>
</ul>
  </p>

<p><strong>Why are you holding this event virtually instead of in person?</strong></p>
  <p>We hated the idea of closing down 2022 without holding a BSides Austin event. However, in-person conferences require far more time and planning to arrange the logistics. A virtual conference made the most sense for all of us to re-engage!</p>

<p><strong>What technology will you be using for this conference?</strong></p>
  <p>We will be streaming the day’s talks using Zoom and facilitating attendee conversations and Q&A with the speakers using Discord.</p>

<p><strong>Will the talks be available after the event?</strong></p>
  <p>When the speaker has agreed to be recorded (not all have), we will upload their talk to our BSides Austin YouTube channel some time after the event has ended.</p>

<p><strong>Will the talks be pre-recorded or live?</strong></p>
  <p>Our talks will be delivered live via Zoom.</p>

<p><strong>Can we get an attendance certificate for CPEs?</strong></p>
  <p>We will provide a certificate after the event.</p>

<p><strong>Do you need volunteers to help out on the day of the event?</strong></p>
  <p>Thanks for asking! We always lean on volunteers to make BSides Austin happen. Because this event is virtual, we will need fewer helpers, and we’re happy to say we already have a sufficient number.
