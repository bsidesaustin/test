<p><strong>What if I bought a ticket to the 2020 conference that was canceled because of Covid and didn’t ask for a refund?</strong></p>
  <p>First, thank you so much for sticking with us through this strange time. Here’s how we are handling your situation:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Before we made the free tickets for this December 2022 virtual conference available to the general public, we emailed the address you used to purchase your 2020 ticket to ensure you had first dibs on a ticket.</li>
  <li>If you didn’t grab your ticket during that pre-sale, we obviously still hope you take advantage of this conference by registering now.</li>
  <li>We are planning an in-person BSides Austin 2023 for spring. Your 2020 ticket purchase means you have a ticket to that event if you want it. We will be in touch with you closer to that conference to inform you of how to register for your pre-paid ticket.</li>
</ul>
