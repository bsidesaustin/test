<p>
The Commons event center recommends using Fedex to ship your packages. You can ship it from this address:
</p>

<pre>
9222 Burnet Rd
Suite 101
Austin, TX 78758
US
Phone: (512) 339-1191
</pre>

<p>Here is a google <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/FedEx+Office+Print+%26+Ship+Center/@30.376538,-97.726302,1867m/data=!3m2!1e3!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x8644cb9170fd7b4d:0xbac4d4dd15063382!8m2!3d30.376538!4d-97.726302!16s%2Fg%2F1tdww269?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI0MTIwMy4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D">maps</a> link. 
</p>
  
<p>You CAN ship from the Commons for pickup between 9 am and 3 pm on Monday ONLY. However, if they have a problem finding this place (which they apparently do), the event center will be closed for a month starting at end of day Monday and there will be no way to get your equipment until they re-open in January. </p> 
  
  <p>We just found out about this. Sorry. :(</p>
